<h3>Description List of Cars</h3>
<dl>
<dt>SEDAN</dt>
<dd>A sedan is a conventional example of a four-door passenger car. More often than not, 
sedans have a 3-box design with separate areas for the engine,
passenger, and cargo, which allows for stable driving thanks to better weight distribution.</dd>
<dt>COUPE</dt>
<dd>A coupe has historically been considered a two-door car with a trunk and a solid roof.</dd>
<dt>SPORT-UTILITY VEHICLE (SUV)</dt>
<dd>UVs—often also referred to as crossovers—tend to be taller and boxier than sedans, offer an elevated seating position, and have more ground clearance than a car.</dd>
<dt>SPORTS CAR</dt>
<dd>These are the sportiest, hottest, coolest-looking coupes and convertibles—low to the ground, sleek, and often expensive. </dd>
<dt>STATION WAGON</dt>
<dd>Wagons are similar to sedans but have an extended roofline and a hatch door at the rear instead of a trunk.</dd>
<dt>HATCHBACK</dt>
<dd>Traditionally, the term "hatchback" has meant a compact or subcompact sedan with a squared-off roof and 
  a rear flip-up hatch door that provides access to the vehicle's cargo area instead of a conventional trunk.</dd>
<dt>CONVERTIBLE</dt>
<dd>Does the roof retract into the body leaving the passenger cabin open to the elements? If so, it's a convertible. </dd>
